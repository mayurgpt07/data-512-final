## Title: Medical Insurance Bills
## Abstract
The goal of the project is to understand medical insurance bills from the perspective of a customer. We first try to analyze the question ***What are the different variables that impact the individual medical insurance cost?*** using different statistical techniques. The answer to the question will give us a score in the form of *"Feature X has a Y(numeric) feature importance"*.<br />
The second question is understand whether ***we can create a model that can compute the medical insurance cost of individual?***. To solve this problem, I have used different methods like *Linear Regression*, *Polynomial Regression*, *L1 Regularized Polynomial Regression* and *Random Forest Regression*. The best model out of the 4 will be used to provide a prediction for an individual that may or may not be present in data.
